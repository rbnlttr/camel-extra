# Setting and Converting #

Added the syntax for setting the header and body of the message, and for converting to a specific type, or using a bean to do conversion. Uh-oh, that outline isn't quite right.

# Block Folding #

One neat little freebie from the editor is the folding - check out the picture below, where I've hidden the route definitions and you just see the start of the definition and an ellipsis. Outline view still shows everything.

# Outline View #

Updated - now the unnamed nodes are gone, the when clauses are in place and the little camels are all happy.

# Recipients and Pipeline #

# What can I put in a Choice? #

# What can I put in a when? #

Here's the completion options visible when attempting to put content into a **when** clause for a choice. Note funcky obsckure error messages. Yes, there is a way to override them, I think.
